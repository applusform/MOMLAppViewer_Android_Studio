# MOMLAppViewer_Android_Studio

The "MOML Application Viewer" is an application for browsing MOML(Mobile Object Markup Language) pages on the web or SD card.
You don't need to build android application for testing MOML pages if the page is in a web server.
Just run "MOML Application Viewer" and type page url.
If you are not familiar or never heard about MOML, you can still look around by using default sample URLs.
MOML Application Viewer automatically saves your recently entered URLs by latest order. It can be deleted by long press the URL list item.
You can return to the first URL list page at anytime with "Quit" menu in option menu. (press device menu key.)
The "Developer Console" menu in option menu is a very useful debugging tool.
You can view logs or sources of current running MOML Pages.
